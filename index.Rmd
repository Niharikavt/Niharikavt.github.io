## About Me

<img src="images/niharika.jpg" style="width:55%">

I am a Masters in Public Health Candidate at [Columbia Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/) with a 
certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science.

I am interested in the intersection of epidemiology, data analysis and infectious diseases. Through my research I want to tackle issues related to economic cost and cost-effectiveness in HIV prevention interventions.

My background is in dentistry and I am advocating to bring cost and cost-effectiveness of infectious disease prevention interventions into discussion at a global level in public health.
